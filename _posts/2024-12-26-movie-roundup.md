When we moved to San Diego, Courtney and I subscribed to AMC A-List. This allowed us to see up to 3 movies per week for "free". Since then, we've seen over 40 movies in theaters this year in lieu of having a rich social calendar and lots
of friends to see frequently. At the bottom of this post, we have our individual tier lists for movies.

Since there's so many in each list, we tallied each movie up and are going to highlight:
1. The best movies we saw
2. The worst movies we saw
3. Our guilty pleasures
4. The movies that made us angry
5. Our individual top picks
6. Our most memorable theater experience

## The best movies we saw this year

### The Substance

**Zach**

I haven’t watched any body horror before, so this was an all new experience. The sound and prop design is gorgeous and horrific, and Demi Moore does an excellent job portraying somebody wracked with wretched self-loathing. The movie moves at a rocketing pace without being overly plot-heavy. It made me feel icky, sad, proud, angry, disgusted.

### Anora

**Zach**

Anora wears its three acts on its sleeve, and has an incredible tone shift between each that blends so naturally. The beginning is so fun, lighthearted, youthful - and as the movie goes on, you watch the characters take on a jaded, defeated atmosphere that parallels many of our own painful lessons learned on the way to becoming adults.


## The worst movies we saw this year

### Trap

**Zach**

I knew that watching an M Night Shyamalan movie is a dicey move, but this was an utter trainwreck that became painful to watch by the end. A bad movie made worse by Shyamalan nepo-babying his daughter into a role of fictional popstar and then somehow the main character in the third act of the film.

### Speak No Evil

**Zach**

This movie makes you frustrated at its lead characters for being passive, ignorant pushovers, and then asks you to accept that as the central theme of the movie.

## Zach's Guilty Pleasure: Alien Romulus
I watched the original Alien movie a day before seeing this one. I loved some of the elements from the original that were brought back and explored further - like the aliens' sensitivity to temperature, or its full lifecycle. The dread and atmosphere of the first act was so wonderful. The darkness and loneliness in space is palpable in those scenes. I really enjoyed David Jonsson's performance and the character he played.

That said, there were some frustrating and cheap thrills, scares, and nostalgia-grabs throughout the movie. I don't need any more shitty CGI of dead actors, please. The last act was a tedious, predictable slog.

I'm a sucker for the Alien franchise, so I really enjoyed this despite it not being my proudest recommendation.

## Courtney's Guilty Pleasure: TBD

## Zach's movie that made him wish he could throw rotten food at the director: Gladiator II
We watched the original Gladiator a week before this came out. There's so many great moments in the original: A lengthy introduction to Maximus, his strengths and his weaknesses, a camraderie between Maximus and his soldiers that is reflected in his leadership in the pits. None of this exists in Gladiator 2.

Hanno's introduction is compressed into brevity, basically into oblivion, and thus builds no sympathy from the audience. Hanno's motivations and key target flips dramatically during the midpoint of the movie, and is completely unearned. The political edge of this movie is dull from overuse. Pedro Pascal and Connie Nielsen are cardboard.

That said, Joseph Quinn really puts his all into his role. I was excited with the stop-motion painted quality of the intro, but that's about the most artistically inspired component of this sequel. The first movie may not be a masterpiece, but it’s an excellent film now sullied by an incompetent sequel.

## Courtney's movie that made her wish she could throw rotten food at the director: It Ends With Us

## Zach's one pick he can't recommend enough: Janet Planet

I watched Janet Planet on a tiny airplane seatback monitor and despite that, this film struck me powerfully.

This is a coming-of-age story not for the main character, 11 year old Lacey, but her mother. Long drawn-out shots evoke a powerful sense of loneliness. There are so many crushing moments where Lacey manages her own schedule, cooks her own food, goes to get ice cream alone, and waits and watches quietly while Janet has exclusive conversations with other adults.

The movie is slow, even plodding. That said, the natural beauty of the setting in Western Massachusetts and the composition of the shots themselves buttress the movie despite the pace. The speed is reminiscent of childhood, where summers can last forever.

In reading reviews online, I was surprised to find that difficult-to-watch moments between Janet and Lacey flew over some people's heads. To relate to this movie might take a level of lived experience - namely the experience of parental enmeshment and how it affects childhood. Heart-breaking moments abound, such as one where Lacey expresses how she's confused why she doesn't have any friends. In childhood, you can feel those missing pieces but not quite place why they're missing. In adulthood, as an outside observer, the reasons are painfully obvious. For Lacey, her lack of friends comes from lack of time spent in spaces designed for children. Her social growth has already been stunted because she's been trusted to exist in adult spaces much younger than she should.

Many, if not most, coming-of-age stories feel distant and unrelatable to me, but this one hit the nail on the head with quite a bit of subtlety and nuance. Beautiful but miserable to watch.

## Courtney's one pick she can't recommend enough: Babes

## Most Positive Movie Watching Moment
We saw Thelma with most of our family that lives in San Diego this summer. It's rare that we go out with all of them: Courtney's Grandma, Mom, Stepdad, and Zach's Dad.

**Zach**

I went into this movie expecting a predictable, humdrum comedy with more than a few jokes about new fangled technology. The story is a bit predictable in the end, sure, but wonderfully executed with many poignant moments scattered throughout.

Watching it with the rest of the family was a special experience, because we all had lost somebody close to us in the last year. We all cried during the movie at least once, and almost all at separate parts. There's so many angles to grief, struggle, and pain throughout the movie without feeling overly dour or gloomy. It ends with hope and triumph while still coming to grips with inevitable loss.

It touches on themes of balancing helping others vs giving them independence, being afraid to ask for help when you really need it, and being afraid to let others risk their health and safety in order to accomplish their own goals. It’s hard not to coddle everybody around us, as we want them to be safe and also do what’s best for them.

This movie hit especially hard after saying goodbye for the last time to my Nana this year. The relationship between Thelma and her grandson spoke to some emotional conversations that I had, and also wished I had, with my own nana.
