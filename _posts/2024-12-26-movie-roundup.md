When we moved to San Diego, Courtney and I subscribed to AMC A-List. This allowed us to see up to 3 movies per week for "free". Since then, we've seen over 40 movies in theaters this year in lieu of having a rich social calendar and lots
of friends to see frequently. At the bottom of this post, we have our individual tier lists for movies.

Since there's so many in each list, we tallied each movie up and are going to highlight:
1. The best movies we saw
2. The worst movies we saw
3. Our guilty pleasures
4. The movies that made us angry
5. Our individual top picks
6. Our most memorable theater experience

## The best movies we saw this year

### The Substance

**Zach**

I haven’t watched any body horror before, so this was an all new experience. The sound and prop design is gorgeous and horrific, and Demi Moore does an excellent job portraying somebody wracked with wretched self-loathing. The movie feels like it moves at a rocketing pace without being overly plot-heavy. It made me feel icky, sad, proud, angry, disgusted.

### Anora

**Zach**

Anora wears its three acts on its sleeve, and has an incredible tone shift between each that blends so naturally. The beginning is so fun, lighthearted, youthful - and as the movie goes on, you watch the characters take on a jaded, defeated atmosphere that parallels many of our own painful lessons learned on the way to becoming adults.


## The worst movies we saw this year

### Trap

**Zach**

I knew that watching an M Night Shyamalan movie is a dicey move, but this was an utter trainwreck that became painful to watch by the end. A bad movie made worse by Shyamalan nepo-babying his daughter into a role of fictional popstar and then somehow the main character in the third act of the film.

### Speak No Evil

**Zach**

This movie makes you frustrated at its lead characters for being passive, ignorant pushovers, and then asks you to accept that as the central theme of the movie.

## Zach's Guilty Pleasure: Alien Romulus
Extremely heavy on plot and lore.

I watched the original Alien movie a day before seeing this one. I loved some of the elements from the original that were brought back and explored further - like the aliens' sensitivity to temperature, or its full lifecycle. The dread and atmosphere of the first act was so wonderful. The darkness and loneliness in space is palpable in those scenes.

That said, there were some frustrating and cheap thrills, scares, and nostalgia-grabs throughout the movie. I don't need any more shitty CGI of dead actors, please. The last act was a tedious, predictable slog.

I'm a sucker for the Alien franchise, so I really enjoyed this despite it not being my proudest recommendation.

## Courtney's Guilty Pleasure: TBD

## Zach's movie that made him wish he could throw rotten food at the director: Gladiator II
I watched the first Gladiator a week before this came out in order to jog my memory. I care so much more for Maximus and his plight than I ever do of Hanno. The first act of Gladiator is compressed into brevity, into oblivion, in Gladiator 2. There’s no camaraderie between Hanno and his fellow “barbarians”, a key part of the sympathy developed for Maximus in the first film. Hanno’s character drastically flips sides and ideologies in one pivotal moment - this is completely unearned. The political edge of this movie is dull from overuse. Pedro Pascal and Connie Nielsen feel cardboard. That said, Joseph Quinn really puts his all into his role and you can feel it. The first movie may not be a masterpiece, but it’s an excellent film now sullied by an incompetent sequel.

## Courtney's movie that made her wish she could throw rotten food at the director: It Ends With Us

## Zach's one pick he can't recommend enough: Janet Planet
A coming-of-age story not for the main character, but her mother, and a look at how parental enmeshment can impact one’s childhood. Long drawn-out shots evoke a powerful sense of loneliness. There are so many crushing moments where 11 year old Lacey manages her own schedule, cooks her own food, goes to get ice cream alone, and waits and watches quietly while Janet has exclusive conversations with other adults. Many, if not most, coming-of-age stories can feel distant and unrelatable to me, but this one hit the nail on the head with quite a bit of subtlety and nuance. Beautifully saddening in many moments.

## Courtney's one pick she can't recommend enough: Babes

## Most Positive Movie Watching Moment


This movie hit especially hard after saying goodbye for the last time to my Nana this year. The themes of balancing help vs independence, being afraid to ask for help when you really need it, and being afraid to let others risk their health and safety in order to accomplish their own goals. It’s hard not to coddle everybody around us, as we want them to be safe and also do what’s best for them. The relationship between Thelma and her grandson spoke to some emotional conversations that I had, and also wished I had, with my own nana.
